Editors like Sublime and TextMate offer convenience but only limited extensibility. On the other end of the spectrum, Emacs and Vim offer extreme flexibility, but they aren&#39;t very approachable and can only be customized with special-purpose scripting languages.</p><p>We think we can do better. Our goal is a zero-compromise combination of hackability and usability: an editor that will be welcoming to an elementary school student on their first day learning to code, but also a tool they won&#39;t outgrow as they develop into seasoned hackers.</p><p>As we&#39;ve used Pulsar to build Pulsar, what began as an experiment has gradually matured into a tool we can&#39;t live without. On the surface, Pulsar is the modern desktop text editor you&#39;ve come to expect. Pop the hood, however, and you&#39;ll discover a system begging to be hacked on.</p><h3 id="the-nucleus-of-pulsar" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-nucleus-of-pulsar" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The Nucleus of Pulsar</h3><p>The web is not without its faults, but two decades of development has forged it into an incredibly malleable and powerful platform. So when we set out to write a text editor that we ourselves would want to extend, web technology was the obvious choice. But first, we had to free it from its chains.</p><h3 id="the-native-web" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-native-web" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The Native Web</h3><p>Web browsers are great for browsing web pages, but writing code is a specialized activity that warrants dedicated tools. More importantly, the browser severely restricts access to the local system for security reasons, and for us, a text editor that couldn&#39;t write files or run local sub-processes was a non-starter.</p><p>For this reason, we didn&#39;t build Pulsar as a traditional web application. Instead, Pulsar is a specialized variant of Chromium designed to be a text editor rather than a web browser. Every Pulsar window is essentially a locally-rendered web page.</p><p>All the APIs available to a typical Node.js application are also available to the code running in each window&#39;s JavaScript context. This hybrid provides a unique client-side development experience.</p><p>Since everything is local, you don&#39;t have to worry about asset pipelines, script concatenation, and asynchronous module definitions. If you want to load some code, just require it at the top of your file. Node&#39;s module system makes it easy to break the system down into lots of small, focused packages.</p><h3 id="javascript-meet-c" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#javascript-meet-c" aria-hidden="true">#</a> JavaScript, Meet C++</h3><p>Interacting with native code is also really simple. For example, we wrote a wrapper around the Oniguruma regular expression engine for our TextMate grammar support. In a browser, that would have required adventures with NaCl or Esprima. Node integration made it easy.</p><p>In addition to the Node APIs, we also expose APIs for native dialogs, adding application and context menu items, manipulating the window dimensions, etc.</p><h3 id="web-tech-the-fun-parts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#web-tech-the-fun-parts" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Web Tech: The Fun Parts</h3><p>Another great benefit, that comes with writing code for Pulsar, is the guarantee that it&#39;s running on the newest version of Chromium. That means we can ignore issues like browser compatibility and polyfills. We can use all the web&#39;s shiny features of tomorrow, today.</p><p>For example, the layout of our workspace and panes is based on flexbox. It&#39;s an emerging standard and has gone through a lot of change since we started using it, but none of that mattered as long as it worked.</p><p>With the entire industry pushing web technology forward, we&#39;re confident that we&#39;re building Pulsar on fertile ground. Native UI technologies come and go, but the web is a standard that becomes more capable and ubiquitous with every passing year. We&#39;re excited to dig deeper into its toolbox.</p><h2 id="an-open-source-text-editor" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#an-open-source-text-editor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> An Open-Source Text Editor</h2><p>We see Pulsar as a great replacement for Atom but we can&#39;t do it without your support going forward, since we know that we can&#39;t achieve our vision for Pulsar alone.
